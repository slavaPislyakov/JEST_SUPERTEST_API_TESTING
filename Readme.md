Jest + Supertest API testing framework:
========================================
1. To intall all dependecies run command: ```npm init```
2. To run test you should run command: ```npm run jest:test ```
3. All test results will be present in ```report.html``` file

> NOTE:
Please do not forget that as a default Jest runs all tests in parallel
